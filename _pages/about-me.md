title: "About Me"

Born and raised in Escondido, CA, I feel a strong connection to the San Diego community.  Today I am grateful to work alongside young learners in San Diego County where my own roots lie!  During my past educational and professional endeavors I have also called parts of Maine, Chile, Spain, and NYC home.  These days I live in Point Loma in a household with my roommates... including one mighty but gentle husky and an energetic dalmation! 

In my time outside of the classroom, I enjoy spending time in nature, baking, going to yoga classes, and discovering new music. I am a lover of adventure... and especially a good road trip!  

As an educator, my first priority is to lead my classroom with love.  I aim to uplift young learners in community and celebrate them as individuals who each have something important to share with the world. It is a great honor to partner with students in the exploration of their own strengths -- a process which inspires me every day. I am so grateful for the daily opportunity to share in new learning experiences.

Growing up, school was my favorite place to be... and now as an adult that's still true!  Teaching truly fills my heart with joy.
